# @borgar/eslint-config

I have opinions on how my code should look. This is a capture of those.

Look at the [example.js](./example.js) to get a feel for what the code looks like. The rules are a bit lax on space at times and depend on the programmer wanting to keep the code legible and clean (don't we all?).
